# Root Cause Tracing

## Overview

Bugs often surface deep in the call stack (a query runs against the wrong table, a file is
created in the wrong place, a connection opens with the wrong DSN). The instinct is to fix
where the error appears — but that's a symptom.

**Core principle:** Trace backward through the call chain until you find the original
trigger, then fix at the source.

## When to Use

- The error happens deep in execution, not at the entry point.
- The traceback shows a long call chain.
- It's unclear where the invalid value originated.
- You need to find which test/code path triggers the problem.

## The Tracing Process

### 1. Observe the symptom
```
asyncpg.exceptions.UndefinedTableError: relation "tenant_.items" does not exist
```

### 2. Find the immediate cause — what code directly raises this?
```python
rows = await conn.fetch(f'SELECT * FROM "tenant_{tenant}".items')
```

### 3. Ask: what called this, and what value did it pass?
```
Repo.list_items(tenant)        ← tenant = ""  (empty!)
  ← Service.list_items(tenant)
  ← route handler  items(tenant = Header(default=""))
  ← test client call with no X-Tenant header
```

### 4. Keep tracing up to the original trigger
The empty string flowed all the way down: the test never set the `X-Tenant` header, the
dependency default was `""`, and nothing rejected it. **Root cause:** missing validation on
the tenant header default — not the SQL.

### 5. Fix at the source, not the symptom
Reject the empty tenant at the boundary (and add defense-in-depth — see
`defense-in-depth.md`), rather than patching the f-string in the repository.

## Capturing a Stack When You Can't Trace Manually

When the call chain isn't obvious, capture a stack at the dangerous operation and run once:

```python
import traceback, logging
log = logging.getLogger("debug")

def git_init(directory: str) -> None:
    log.error("about to git init in %r\ncwd=%s\n%s",
              directory, os.getcwd(), "".join(traceback.format_stack()))
    subprocess.run(["git", "init"], cwd=directory, check=True)
```

In tests, prefer `logging`/`print` over a suppressed logger, and log **before** the operation
(not after it fails). Include directory, cwd, env vars, and the captured stack — then read the
stack for the test file and line number that triggered the call.

## Finding Which Test Triggers It

If the bad state appears during the suite but you don't know which test, use the bisection
script `find-polluter.sh` in this directory:

```bash
./find-polluter.sh '.git_artifact' 'tests'
```

## Key Principle

```
Found immediate cause → can trace one level up?
   yes → trace backward → is this the source?
            no  → keep tracing
            yes → fix at source + add validation at each layer (bug becomes impossible)
   no  → NEVER fix just the symptom; instrument and gather more evidence first
```

**Never fix only where the error appears.** Trace back to the original trigger.
