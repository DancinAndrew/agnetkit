# Systematic Debugging

## Overview

Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

This is the missing counterpart to `error-handling` (how to *write* error handling) — this
skill is how to *find* the bug. For confirming a fix actually worked, pair with
`verification-loop`; for the failing test in Phase 4, pair with `tdd-workflow`.

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

## When to Use

Use for ANY technical issue: test failures, production bugs, unexpected behavior,
performance problems, build failures, integration issues.

**ESPECIALLY when:** under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting), "just one
quick fix" seems obvious, you've already tried multiple fixes, the previous fix didn't work,
or you don't fully understand the issue.

**Don't skip when:** the issue seems simple (simple bugs have root causes too), you're in a
hurry (rushing guarantees rework), or someone wants it fixed NOW (systematic is faster than
thrashing).

## The Four Phases

Complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

1. **Read error messages carefully.** Don't skip past errors or warnings — they often
   contain the exact solution. Read tracebacks completely; note line numbers, file paths,
   exception types.
2. **Reproduce consistently.** Can you trigger it reliably? Exact steps? Every time? If not
   reproducible → gather more data, don't guess.
3. **Check recent changes.** `git diff`, recent commits, new dependencies, config or
   environment differences.
4. **Gather evidence in multi-component systems.** When the system has multiple boundaries
   (FastAPI route → service → repository → DB), add diagnostic instrumentation at each
   boundary BEFORE proposing fixes — log what enters and exits each component, then run once
   to see WHERE it breaks.

   ```python
   import logging, os
   log = logging.getLogger("debug")

   log.error("ROUTE in: user_id=%r filters=%r", user_id, filters)          # boundary 1
   log.error("SERVICE: db=%s", os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL", "UNSET"))     # boundary 2
   log.error("REPO query: %s params=%r", query, params)                     # boundary 3
   rows = await conn.fetch(query, *params)
   log.error("REPO out: rows=%d", len(rows))                                # boundary 4
   ```

   This reveals which layer fails (route ✓ → service ✓ → repo ✗), so you investigate the
   *right* component instead of guessing.
5. **Trace data flow backward.** When the error is deep in the call stack, the instinct is
   to fix where it appears — that's a symptom. Trace backward to the original trigger and fix
   at the source. See **`root-cause-tracing.md`** in this directory for the full backward-
   tracing technique and stack-capture recipe.

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

1. **Find working examples** — locate similar working code in the same codebase.
2. **Compare against references** — if implementing a pattern, read the reference
   implementation COMPLETELY. Don't skim.
3. **Identify differences** — list every difference between working and broken, however
   small. Don't assume "that can't matter."
4. **Understand dependencies** — what config, env, fixtures, or assumptions does it need?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

1. **Form a single hypothesis.** State it: "I think X is the root cause because Y." Write it
   down. Be specific.
2. **Test minimally.** Make the SMALLEST possible change to test it. One variable at a time.
3. **Verify before continuing.** Worked? → Phase 4. Didn't? → form a NEW hypothesis. Don't
   stack more fixes on top.
4. **When you don't know, say so.** "I don't understand X." Don't pretend. Research or ask.

### Phase 4: Implementation

1. **Create a failing test first.** Simplest possible reproduction (a pytest case, or a
   one-off script if no framework fits). You MUST have it before fixing. Use `tdd-workflow`.
2. **Implement a single fix** addressing the root cause. ONE change. No "while I'm here"
   refactors.
3. **Verify the fix** — test passes now, no other tests broken, issue actually resolved
   (run `verification-loop`).
4. **If the fix doesn't work: STOP and count attempts.** `< 3` → return to Phase 1 with the
   new information. **`≥ 3` → stop and question the architecture (below).**
5. **If 3+ fixes failed, question the architecture.** Pattern: each fix reveals new
   coupling/shared-state elsewhere, fixes need "massive refactoring," each fix creates new
   symptoms. That's not a failed hypothesis — it's a wrong architecture. Discuss with your
   human partner before attempting fix #4.

After fixing at the source, **harden the data path** so the bug can't recur through a
different route — see **`defense-in-depth.md`** in this directory.

## Supporting Techniques (in this directory)

- **`root-cause-tracing.md`** — trace a bug backward through the call stack to the original
  trigger; how to capture a stack at the dangerous operation.
- **`defense-in-depth.md`** — after finding root cause, validate at every layer so the bug
  becomes structurally impossible.
- **`condition-based-waiting.md`** — replace arbitrary `time.sleep()` in flaky async/IO
  tests with condition polling.
- **`find-polluter.sh`** — bisection script: find which test leaves a file/row/global behind.
  Usage: `./find-polluter.sh '.git_artifact' 'tests'`

## Red Flags — STOP and Return to Phase 1

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that" (before tracing data flow)
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "One more fix attempt" (when you've already tried 2+)
- Each fix reveals a new problem in a different place

**All of these mean: STOP.** If 3+ fixes failed, question the architecture.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | The first fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |
| "I'll write the test after confirming the fix" | Untested fixes don't stick. Test-first proves it. |
| "Multiple fixes at once saves time" | Can't isolate what worked; causes new bugs. |
| "Reference too long, I'll adapt the pattern" | Partial understanding guarantees bugs. Read it completely. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause. |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Question the pattern, don't fix again. |

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, check changes, instrument boundaries, trace backward | Understand WHAT and WHY |
| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare completely | Identify every difference |
| **3. Hypothesis** | Form one theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| **4. Implementation** | Failing test → single fix → verify → harden | Bug resolved, tests pass |

**95% of "there's no root cause" cases are incomplete investigation.** If investigation
genuinely shows the issue is environmental/external, document what you checked, add
appropriate handling (retry/timeout/clear error), and add monitoring for next time.
